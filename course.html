        <p>The Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) was introduced by the Government of India in year 1950 to ensure a steady flow of skilled workers in different trades for the domestic industry, to raise quantitatively and qualitatively the industrial production by systematic training, to reduce unemployment among the educated youth by providing them employable skills, to cultivate and nurture a technical and industrial attitude in the minds of younger generation. The Scheme is the most important in the field of Vocational Training, has been shaping craftsmen to meet the existing as well as future manpower need, through the vast network of ITIs spread over various States / Union Territories in the country. The day-to-day administration of ITIs under the Craftsmen Training Scheme was transferred to the State Governments/ Union Territory administrations with effect from the year 1956. From 1st April 1969, the financial control of the Industrial Training Institutes in the States as well as in the Union Territories was transferred to the respective State Governments / Union Territory. The financial assistance was granted to them in the form of bulk grant in consultation with the erstwhile Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance.
            Vocational Training is a concurrent subject of both Central and State Governments. The development of training schemes at National level, the evolution of policy, laying of training standard, norms, conducting of examinations, certification, etc. are the responsibilities of the central government, whereas, day to day administration including an admission in ITIs rests with the respective State Governments / UTs.
           Presently, training courses under the Craftsmen Training Scheme are being offered through a network of 14955 ITIs (Govt. 3248 + Private 11707) located all over the country with total trainees enrolled 26.58 lakhs (in the trades of 1 year and 2 year durations) on NCVTMIS portal with an objective to provide skilled workforce to the industry in 150 NSQF compliant trades.</p>
