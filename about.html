    <h3>About Jaipur</h3>
jaipur,the capital of rajastha is abeautiful and historical city that attract tourists worldwide. it is popularly known as the pink city because of exclusive pink stones used for bulidings the monuments
Jaipur gets its name from its founder Maharaja Jai Singh II (1693-1744) the great warrior and astronomer. He came to power at the age of 11 on the death of his father Maharaja Bishan Singh. The maharaja was told that his son would achieve greatness and he set out to ensure that Jai Singh had a good education.
Maharaja Ram Singh also built Ramgarh lake to supply water to the burgeoning city. During the 19th and 20th centuries the city’s population spread beyond its walls. In 1922 Man Singh II, Jaipur’s Maharaja ascended the throne and it was during his reign that civic buildings like the secretariat, schools, hospitals and other public buildings were built. After independence, Jaipur merged with the states of Jodhpur ,Jaisalmer and Bikaner to become the greater Rajasthan union. Man Singh II was bestowed with the title of Rajapramukh and given charge of the new province .The title was later revoked and in 1956, Jaipur became the capital of the state of Rajasthan.
